    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p class="description">I was responsible for design research, strategy, visual production, product management and managed the development team.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="" style="width:240px;">
    <h4>THE TEAM</h4>
    <p class="description">The remaining product team was made up of 2 stakeholders (co-founders), 1 database architect, and 1 full stack developer.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="" style="width:240px;">
    <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
    <p class="description">A product convertion to a Progressive Web App (PWA) that shows local service providers based on the users’ location</p>
  </div>

  <div class="" style="width:330px;">
    <h4>Additional artifacts produced</h4>
    <p class="description">
      <ul>
        <li>Segmented SEM pages (SEO)</li>
        <li>Segmented acquisition pages (Lead gen)</li>
        <li>Tiered listing pages</li>
        <li>Updated app homepage</li>

    <h4>Project overview</h4>
    <p class="description">Design Goal: Improve the connection between service providers listed and local customers who need those services.</p>

<p class="description">Design Task: Move the product marketing away from a focus on horse stable discovery and business listing generation to a segmented approach of horse service discovery and business listing generation so each audience only saw the value proposition that pertains to them.</p>

<p class="description">Why was this the task:
From a communication standpoint, the value proposition to each audience wasn’t clear enough to its intended audience. The initial site was trying to communicate to multiple audiences as a one-to-all communicator and that wasn’t being effective.</p>

<p class="description">Service providers were not sure of why they needed to be in the directory.
Customers were not aware of the selection of services listed and felt it was a directory of horse stables only.</p>

<p class="description">The business saw a blocker to customer and service provider acquisition before the audiences saw the value of the site.</p>

<p class="description">This was validated through analytics, on-page behavior mapping(clicks and page depth analysis) and short-form perception tests of content (A/B tests).

      <p class="description">The business was not currently tracking on-site search query</p>
      <p class="description">Spam data in analytics influencing decisions</p>
      <p class="description">Service providers had a lower technical knowledge, and didn’t want to have to manage “the website”.

Traffic to pages was from low bandwidth areas of connectivity. (3G or less, with inconsistent connections aka rural areas)</p>

  <p class="description">SEO of existing service provider pages ranked well as landing pages / higher than parent business (which was great since this was delivering on the value for the service provider.)

    <p class="description">There was a large drop off of user flow after visiting the primary landing page</p>

        <p class="description">

  <p class="description">
    With a number of challenges discovered, I started to categorize the time it would take to address each one. This is a small non-technical team, and I wanted to deliver results as soon as possible without requiring much from them. Essentially “just make the problems go away”.</p>

<p class="description">Quick fixes:
Spam data in analytics influencing decisions
In order to make clear decisions, you have to have clear data. I set up additional views in the businesses’ Google Analytics account to filter out spam and bot traffic, blocked the IPs of anyone on the team so their behavior wasn’t contributing to the data collection and set tracking tags to watch for specific behavior on site that was deemed important. Clicks of a listing phone number or email address for example.</p>

<p class="description">The business was not currently tracking on-site search query
Users of the site were searching for things, the business didn’t know what they were searching for though. Adding the ability to track queries in on-site search fields gave the business more insight into where visitors were searching for services (California, Atlanta, etc), or what specific services were being searched for, (“stables” vs “boarding” vs “horse boarding”.</p>

<p class="description">Page speed performance was low
Traffic to pages was from low bandwidth areas of connectivity. (3G or less, with inconsistent connections aka rural areas)
Initial page load of key pages took Xsecs or more on lower connectivity devices contributing to visitors not seeing the value proportion of the business and leaving before the page finished loading. By utilizing techniques for page speed optimization and best practices for building a PWA (progressive web app, reduction of resource blocking to get content on screen before it’s styled, asynchronously loading selected javascript files, precaching key pages on load) I was able to reduce the initial page load speed to Xsecs and make repeat visits load almost instantly.</p>

<p class="description">
Medium fixes:

% of page drop off after visiting primary landing page
By identifying the distict audience segments I was able to focus the content and value proposition through separate landing pages for each segment (customers and service providers). No more one page for all approach, now customers looking for services and each of the types of service providers had a landing page promoting the benefit of the business had to them.

<p class="description">
Service providers had a lower technical knowledge, didn’t want to have to manage “the website”
Through the dedicated landing page for that category of a service provider, the content communicated “an easy way to promote your business online”, by simply keeping your business offerings and contact information up to date.

<p class="description">
Ongoing fixes:
Adjustments to onsite search result experience
Based on the data collected from the on-site search feature we found customers were searching more for service types than based on location. We adjusted the display of search results to be prioritized based on distance from the users’ general location using their IP address location.</p>

<p class="description">
Expanding the reach of SEM and capturing more search traffic from search engines.
Since the data showed there was good traffic coming into the directory listings directly via search engine results traffic can enter a site like this from any of the published listing pages we wanted to widen the pathway into the directory. Not every visitor knows the name of the service provider, we wanted to provide options for more general queries based on state, city, and service category. This led to the creation of consolidated listing pages.</p>

          <h4>Service search</h4>
          <p class="description">If the type of service wasn’t displayed, a service search feature became an important function for users. It also provided insight to GoHorse of what type of service or area their users were commonly searching for.</p>
