If you're a creative entrepreneur like me, there’s one question that inevitably pops up on your journey: *Should I stay solo as a freelancer or scale into an agency?* It’s a big decision, and trust me, I’ve walked through every stage—from freelancing in coffee shops to managing a boutique agency and even working alongside a full-fledged team structure.

Today, I’m pulling back the curtain to share what I’ve learned about each of these paths. Whether you’re a die-hard solo act, curious about taking the leap to managing a small team, or dreaming of running a thriving agency, this post is for you. By the end, you’ll have clarity on the unique perks and challenges of each business model and how to decide which one aligns with *your* goals and lifestyle.


## Freelancing: The Nimble Creative

Freelancing is where most of us start. It’s simple, lean, and all about your individual creativity. There’s something magical about being your own boss, picking the projects that excite you, and building your personal brand. Freelancing gives you freedom in a way that no other business model does—you decide when, where, and how you work.

But let’s not sugarcoat it. Freelancing isn’t all rainbows and latte art. You’re juggling all the hats: client work, marketing, bookkeeping, and even IT troubleshooting when your Wi-Fi acts up. And while you have control over your schedule, you’ll likely find yourself tied to your laptop more than you’d like—especially if you’re not setting boundaries.

The earning potential as a freelancer is also limited by time. You only have so many hours in a day, and unless you start raising your rates (which you *should*), there’s a ceiling on what you can earn solo. Plus, it can get lonely out there. Without a team to bounce ideas off, the creative process can feel isolating.


## The Boutique Agency: Expanding Horizons

At some point, many freelancers hit a crossroads. You’ve maxed out your capacity, clients keep knocking, and you’re left wondering, *What’s next?* For me, the answer was stepping into a boutique agency model.

With a small team, suddenly, you can say “yes” to bigger, more complex projects. Your bandwidth increases, your offerings diversify, and your work gets a fresh perspective thanks to the collective expertise of your team. It’s also rewarding to create opportunities for others—watching your team grow and seeing their contributions elevate your work.

But make no mistake, running a boutique agency isn’t just a scaled-up version of freelancing. It’s a whole new skill set. You’re managing people, delegating tasks, and balancing creative direction with operational logistics. It’s challenging, but if you thrive in leadership and enjoy working collaboratively, the boutique agency model can be incredibly fulfilling.

For me, one of the biggest rewards of this stage was having a bit more breathing room. I wasn’t doing *everything* anymore, which allowed me to focus on growing the business, building relationships, and refining our processes.


## The Full-Fledged Agency: Profit and Complexity

Taking things to the next level with a full-fledged agency is a dream for some and a nightmare for others—it all depends on your goals.

When you’re running a larger agency, the stakes are higher, but so are the rewards. A full team, structured processes, and larger projects mean you can achieve greater profitability and scale your impact. You’re no longer just selling your time—you’re leveraging the collective expertise of your team to create something much bigger.

But, as your agency grows, your role shifts dramatically. You’re no longer the creative force behind every project; instead, you become the visionary leader steering the ship. For some, this shift is empowering—it allows you to focus on strategy and leadership. For others, it feels like losing touch with the creative work that got you started in the first place.


## Finding Your Sweet Spot

Here’s the thing: there’s no “right” choice between freelancing, boutique agencies, and full-fledged agencies. Each path comes with its own rewards, challenges, and lifestyle implications. The real question is, *What does success look like for you?*

For some, success is the flexibility and autonomy of freelancing. For others, it’s the collaborative growth of a boutique agency. And for a few, it’s building a powerhouse agency that runs like a machine.

The key is to define your version of “enough.” You don’t have to chase growth for the sake of growth. If freelancing gives you the balance you crave, that’s valid. If managing a team gives you purpose and direction, lean into it. And if you’re ready to scale to the moon, go for it—but know what you’re signing up for.


## Wrapping It Up

Freelancing, boutique agencies, full-fledged agencies—they’re all just different ways of creating value and building a business you love. The trick is to choose the model that aligns with your goals, your values, and the life you want to lead.

Wherever you are in your creative journey, embrace it fully. There’s no one-size-fits-all path to success, and sometimes, the best move isn’t “up” but deeper into what makes you thrive.
