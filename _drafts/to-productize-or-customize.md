Today, I’m discussing one of my most persistent debates: whether to productize or customize my services for each client. This debate is as old as our industry, but getting it right can be the difference between a smooth-running business and a constant battle.

When I first started offering my services in the design industry, I provided either a fixed selection of services or tried to tailor every project to the client’s unique needs. Both approaches have pros and cons, and I often wondered, “What’s the best way to create value without burning out?” 

Over time, I discovered that neither was the answer. Instead, it’s about finding your sweet spot—a balanced hybrid that matches your strengths and meets your clients’ expectations.

In this post, I’ll share my experiences, lessons learned, and practical tips on determining whether productization or customization (or a mix of both) is the right approach for your creative business.


## The Case for Productization

Productizing your services means creating a clear, repeatable set of offerings. For me, this approach brings several key benefits:



* **Efficiency and Scale:** When you know what you’re delivering each time, you can streamline your process, reduce errors, and ultimately take on more projects without reinventing the wheel.
* **Ease of Communication:** productized services are straightforward. They make it simple for potential clients to understand what you offer and why it’s valuable.
* **Operational Consistency:** I know the exact tasks for a project with defined processes. This clarity helps in training, quality control, and meeting client expectations.
* **Pricing Simplicity:** Fixed packages eliminate the endless back-and-forth of negotiating bespoke rates, making your value proposition transparent and your revenue predictable.

That said, while productization is efficient, it can sometimes feel inflexible. There’s a risk of being unable to cater to unique client needs or missing out on opportunities for deeper personalization.


## The Appeal of Customization

Conversely, customization is about tailoring your offerings to each client’s needs. This approach is a game-changer for creating unique value and building strong relationships:



* **Unique Value Proposition:** Custom solutions let you address a client’s specific challenges, which often means fewer price objections and a willingness to pay a premium.
* **High-End Appeal:** Clients looking for bespoke services will always value personalized attention. It sets you apart as an expert who goes above and beyond.
* **Competitive Differentiation:** When you craft tailor-made solutions, you position yourself as a thoughtful problem-solver who doesn’t just offer cookie-cutter answers.
* **Relationship Building:** Deep, customized engagements build trust and often lead to long-term, loyal client relationships.

However, customization can come with challenges—efficiency might suffer if every project feels like starting from scratch, and pricing can become unpredictable.


## Finding Your Balance: The Hybrid Approach

After years of experimenting, I’ve found that the secret often lies in a hybrid approach. It’s about having a solid, productized foundation for your services while allowing room for customization where it counts.

For instance, I have a core service package for creating a marketing website, with optional add-ons for clients who need more customization for specific features. This way, I get the best of both worlds: operational efficiency and the ability to deliver personalized solutions.


## Final Thoughts

Choosing between productization and customization isn’t a one-size-fits-all decision. It depends on your business goals, market, and, most importantly, your style. The goal is to create a business model that works efficiently, resonates with your clients, and supports your creative vision.
