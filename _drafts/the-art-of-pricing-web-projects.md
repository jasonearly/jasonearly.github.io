Let’s talk about one of the trickiest yet most important aspects of running a design business: pricing your web projects.

I know the struggle. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the numbers, overthink how much is “too much” or “too little,” and worry about scaring off potential clients. But here’s the thing—getting your pricing right is more than just picking a number. It’s about understanding value, mastering client conversations, and creating a strategy that makes sense for you *and* your client.

And if that sounds like a lot, don’t worry—I’ve got you covered. In this post, I’m unpacking my step-by-step approach to pricing web projects with confidence and clarity. 


## The Three Pillars of Pricing

When it comes to pricing web projects, I focus on three pillars:

1.	**Production Cost**: How much is this going to cost *you*? Factor in your time, subcontractors, tools, and software.
2.	**Market Value**: What are others charging for similar work? Research rates in your niche to get a sense of what’s standard.
3.	**Client Expectations**: What’s your client conditioned to pay? Their budget often reveals what they believe is valuable (and what they don’t).

Start with these three pillars, and you’ll have a solid foundation for setting realistic, profitable rates.


## Talking Money Early

Here’s the deal—money is awkward for a lot of people, but leaving budget conversations until the end of a sales call can backfire. That’s why I bring it up right away.

For example, I might say something like:

“We’ve done websites ranging from $8,000 to $15,000. Does that fit within your budget?”

Clients often need a minute to process, especially if they’ve never spent much on marketing before. 

But getting their reaction early gives you valuable insight into where they stand and allows you to align expectations before diving into project details.


## Breaking Down Your Pricing

Once you’ve got a sense of the client’s budget and needs, it’s time to craft your pitch. I like to offer tiered options to give clients flexibility while showcasing the value I bring.

Here’s how I might structure a project:


**Entry-Level ($2,000):** A single-page website with a simple layout and basic functionality. Great for startups or those on a tight budget.


**Mid-Tier ($5,500 - $6,000):** A multi-page website with custom design, improved UX, and added features like contact forms or light animations. The mid-tier is often the sweet spot for many clients.


**High-End ($10,000+):** A full-service, multi-page site with advanced functionality—think e-commerce, online reservations, integrations, etc.

This approach not only makes your pricing transparent, but it also positions you as a professional offering tailored solutions. It’s not just about “how much” you’re charging—it’s about “what” they’re getting in return.

## Backing Up Your Pricing

Here’s a pro tip: always have market research ready. If a client questions your rates, show them the data. For instance, a quick Google search of similar services in your niche can prove that your prices align with industry standards.

This not only justifies your pricing but also reinforces your credibility as a professional who knows their worth.


## Final Thoughts

Pricing doesn’t have to feel like a guessing game. When you combine production cost, market research, and client expectations, you’re not just throwing out numbers—you’re creating a strategy that’s both profitable and fair.
