Let me ask you this: What keeps your clients up at night? What are the nagging worries that pop into their heads the moment their heads hit the pillow? These are their **"core problems"**—the deeper, emotional concerns hiding beneath the surface-level requests. And as a creative entrepreneur, uncovering and solving these hidden challenges can completely change the game for your business.

This post is all about shifting your mindset. It’s about going beyond fulfilling surface-level requests ("surface problems") and diving into the core issues that keep your clients tossing and turning. If you’ve ever felt like you were just checking off a to-do list instead of truly making an impact, this one’s for you.

Stick with me because this small—but powerful—shift can elevate your work from transactional to transformational. Plus, by the end of this post, you'll have actionable steps to uncover your clients’ core problems and position yourself as the go-to problem-solver they can’t live without. Alright, let’s dive in!


## What Are Surface vs. Core Problems?

First, let’s clarify the difference between surface and core problems.

**Surface Problems** are the surface-level needs clients come to you with: "I need a new website," "We need a rebrand," or "Can you design a flyer for our event?" They’re practical, straightforward, and usually tied to a specific deliverable.  
**Core Problems** go much deeper. These are the emotional, high-stakes concerns driving their surface requests. They’re the fears, frustrations, or aspirations that keep them awake at night.  

For example, when a client says, "I need a new website," their real (core) problem might be:

Their website is driving away customers instead of converting them.  
A competitor is stealing market share with a sleeker, more modern design.  
They feel their brand is outdated, and it’s hurting their reputation.  

As creative entrepreneurs, addressing these core problems is what sets us apart. When you tackle the emotional and strategic needs beneath the surface, you go from being a service provider to being an invaluable partner in their success.


## How to Identify Core Problems

Here’s the secret: You don’t solve core problems by taking requests at face value. You uncover them by digging deeper and asking the right questions.



**Listen Beyond the Request:** Pay attention to what your clients aren’t saying. Listen to their tone, frustrations, and aspirations.  
**Ask Probing Questions:** Go beyond “What do you need?” Ask “Why do you need it?” and “What’s at stake if this isn’t addressed?”  
**Empathize and Reflect:** Show that you understand their challenges. Reassure them that you’ve helped others overcome similar obstacles.  


#### Examples of Turning Surface Problems into Core Solutions

1. **The Logo Redesign**
    * **Surface Problem:** “We need a new logo.”
    * **Core Problem:** “Our current branding makes us look outdated. We’re losing customers to competitors who appear more modern and innovative.”
    * **Solution:** A rebranding strategy that revitalizes their image, attracts their ideal audience, and reinforces their position as an industry leader. 

2. **The Brochure Request**
    * **Surface Problem:** “We need a brochure for our accounting firm.”
    * **Core Problem:** “We’re struggling to compete with newer firms that are leveraging modern digital marketing to win clients.”
    * **Solution:** A multi-platform strategy that includes a fresh brochure, a compelling website update, and a targeted social media campaign to help them stay competitive.


## Why This Shift Matters

When you focus on core problems, you:

**Differentiate Yourself:** You’re no longer just “another designer” or “another marketer.” You’re the person who *gets* them.  
**Build Deeper Relationships:** Clients trust you more when they see you’re invested in their success.  
 **Increase Your Value:** Solving big-picture problems justifies premium pricing and opens doors to long-term partnerships.  


## Actionable Steps to Solve Core Problems



1. **Start Every Project with Discovery**  
Dedicate time to understanding the full context of your client’s request. Use discovery calls or questionnaires to dig deeper. 

2. **Frame Solutions Around Benefits**  
Instead of pitching features, highlight how your solution directly addresses their concerns. For example: “This rebrand will help you stand out in a competitive market and attract higher-paying clients.” 

3. **Communicate Your Process**  
Explain that your work isn’t just about deliverables—it’s about solving their real challenges. This reinforces your expertise and justifies your approach. 

4. **Deliver Value Beyond Expectations**  
Address the surface problem, but go above and beyond by proactively solving the core problem. For example, if they request a website refresh, include recommendations for SEO improvements or content strategies to boost conversions. 



## Conclusion

Here’s the truth: Most creative entrepreneurs stick to solving surface problems. And sure, that’ll get you by. But if you want to stand out, charge premium rates, and build lasting client relationships, you need to address the core problems that really matter.

Start listening for the unspoken worries. Be the partner who tackles the challenges your clients didn’t even know they needed help with. Trust me—this shift will transform your business.
