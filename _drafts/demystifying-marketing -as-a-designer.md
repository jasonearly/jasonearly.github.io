Today, I want to share something near and dear to my heart: marketing yourself as a designer.
If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed at the thought of "putting yourself out there," you’re not alone. Trust me, I’ve been there. Yes, marketing, I know—it’s a word that sends chills down most creatives' spines. But here’s the thing: it’s just as important as your design skills. And if you want to build a thriving career, mastering marketing is non-negotiable. So, let’s dive into the strategies that will help you market yourself authentically and consistently.

## Embracing the Business Side of Creativity
As creatives, we’re wired to focus on the craft—the designs, the visuals, the aesthetics. But building a sustainable career isn’t just about being good at what you do (although that’s obviously important!). It’s also about getting your work in front of the right people, at the right time. And that requires intention in how you present yourself, how you show up, and how you market your skills.
The good news? You don’t need to overhaul your personality or become a stereotypical salesperson. Marketing, at its core, is about building relationships, sharing your value, and staying top of mind.

## The Power of Consistency: Hope is Not a Strategy
One of the biggest lessons to learn is the power of consistency. So many creatives rely on hope—hope that their portfolio will speak for itself, hope that referrals will keep coming, hope that the next client will magically find them. Spoiler alert: hope is not a strategy.
Instead, try this: create a "staying top of mind" spreadsheet. This is where you track every client, collaborator, or contact you’ve worked with professionally. Make it a point to reconnect with them regularly—not to sell, but to genuinely maintain the relationship. Share a resource you think they’d find helpful, congratulate them on a recent milestone, or just check in. This small, consistent effort ensures you’re the first person they think of when they have a design need.

## Networking: It’s Not Just a Buzzword
I get it—networking can feel awkward or time-consuming, especially for those of us who are more introverted. But hear me out: it doesn’t have to be about handing out business cards at stuffy events. Networking is about creating opportunities to meet people, learn from them, and share what you bring to the table.
Look for local entrepreneur meetups, industry luncheons, or even online communities where your ideal clients hang out. The goal isn’t to pitch yourself at every turn but to build genuine relationships. Over time, those connections will naturally turn into leads or referrals.

## Building Authority: Own Your Expertise
This is a big one. If you’re not building authority in your niche, you’re missing out on a major marketing opportunity. Think about it—why would a client choose you over someone else? Because you’ve proven, through your content and actions, that you’re an expert in your space.
Pick a platform you enjoy using—whether it’s Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, or your own blog—and start sharing value. Showcase your work, explain your process, or share quick tips for solving common design challenges. The key here is consistency. You don’t need to post every day, but you do need to show up regularly enough that people remember you.

## Cold Emails: Strategic, Not Spammy
Cold emails can feel intimidating, but when done right, they’re one of the most effective ways to land clients. Here’s the trick: don’t make it generic.
Start by identifying potential clients or companies you’d love to work with. Follow them on LinkedIn or Instagram, engage with their posts, and get a feel for their needs. Then, craft a personalized email that shows you understand their challenges and offers a solution. Bonus points if you include a link to a landing page tailored specifically for them—it’s an extra touch that shows you’ve done your homework.

## Who Sells You Best? You!
Thinking you could hire a salesperson to handle this for you? While delegating lead generation can save you time, when it comes to closing the deal, nobody sells you better than you. Your passion for what you do, your deep understanding of your process, and your ability to connect with potential clients on a personal level are all things a salesperson can’t replicate. So, if you’re considering this route, keep yourself involved in the final stages of the sales process—it makes a world of difference.

## Looking Forward: Intentional Marketing for Creatives
At the end of the day, marketing isn’t about trying to be someone you’re not. It’s about being strategic, consistent, and intentional in how you present yourself to the world. Reflect on your current approach—what’s working? What’s not? Where can you improve?
For me, writing this is a great reminder to focus on relationship-building rather than just chasing leads. Marketing, when done right, isn’t a chore—it’s an opportunity to connect, create, and grow. And as a creative entrepreneur, those are things we thrive on.
So, what’s one small marketing step you can take today? Whether it’s starting your "top of mind" spreadsheet, reaching out to a past client, or sharing your work on social media, take that first step. I promise, the results are worth it.
