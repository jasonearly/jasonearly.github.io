Let me ask you something—what gets you out of bed in the morning? Is it a passion that lights a fire in your soul, a skill you’ve mastered, or a way to create a lasting impact? Imagine combining all three. That’s the magic of the “Hedgehog Concept”.

Today I’m unpacking the art of finding your Hedgehog Concept, a powerful framework from Jim Collins’ book *Good to Great*. If you’re curious about how to align your passion, skills, and income, keep reading—this could be the turning point you’ve been waiting for. 


## What is the Hedgehog Concept?

The Hedgehog Concept is all about finding clarity in the chaos. It’s the sweet spot where three things intersect:



1. **What you’re deeply passionate about**
2. **What you can be the best in the world at**
3. **What drives your economic engine**

When you identify this trifecta, you unlock your unique zone of genius. Here’s how this concept plays out in real life, using my creative journey as a case study.


## Passion Fuels Creativity

My passion is creating—whether it’s cooking, designing, or producing content. I live for the process of making something from scratch, watching an idea take shape and come to life. But here’s the thing: the magic isn’t just in creating for myself. What truly inspires me is how creation can connect people. 

Takeaway for you? If you’re trying to uncover your passion, think about the activities that make you lose track of time. What’s that one thing you’d do even if no one paid you? That’s your starting point.


## Teaching: A Superpower in Disguise

One of the things I pride myself on is my ability to break down complex ideas and make them fun, relatable, and easy to understand. Whether it’s through a workshop, a podcast, or one of my courses, I focus on turning intimidating concepts into “aha!” moments that actually stick.

For me, teaching isn’t just about sharing knowledge—it’s about creating an experience. It’s about making learning enjoyable, engaging, and, most importantly, actionable. When you can do that, you’re not just teaching—you’re making an impact.

So, let me ask you this: What do people come to *you* for advice about? What’s that thing they always ask you to explain or help them with? Because odds are, that’s your hidden superpower. You just need to lean into it.


## Turning Passion into Profit

The last piece of the puzzle is your economic engine. I don’t just create for the fun of it (though I do love the process)—I’ve built a sustainable business by leveraging my skills and turning what I’m good at into something that works for me. From online courses to coaching, I’ve found a way to make my passion pay off.

If you’re trying to figure out how to monetize *your* skills, start by thinking about the value you provide. Are you helping people save time? Teaching them something new? Giving them a sense of belonging or connection? Once you understand the unique value you bring to the table, you can start crafting offers that align with it and start building something meaningful.


## Key Takeaways for Building Your Hedgehog Concept

Here’s how you can start uncovering your own:



1. **Passion is the foundation**: Find what makes you feel alive and pursue it.
2. **Mastery amplifies your impact**: Focus on becoming exceptional at what you do.
3. **Monetization is the bridge**: Identify how your passion and skills can generate income.

When you align these three areas, you’ll not only thrive professionally—you’ll live a life of purpose and meaning.


## Ready to Discover Your Hedgehog Concept?

Finding your Hedgehog Concept is more than a business strategy—it’s a personal breakthrough. It’s the difference between just “doing” and truly *thriving.* And it’s worth the effort to dig deep and figure out your unique intersection.
