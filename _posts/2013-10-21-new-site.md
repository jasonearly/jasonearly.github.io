Well it's time for a site update. For this iteration I wanted to try out Jekyll and see if I can force myself to write more. For now the whole site is pretty vanilla. Default styles from Bootstrap and Jekyll, with a focus on "just getting things to work". I spent a day over the weekend building and testing so I'm sure there are some kinks to work out yet. As for now though, it works.

Another focus for the site is to try out some modern front-end frameworks. I've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks exploring Yeoman, Grunt, Bower and AngularJS. There's more to say about these in future articles but it's been great getting my hands dirty in code again.

So for now this is it. A new site/sandbox to play in and test out ideas.
