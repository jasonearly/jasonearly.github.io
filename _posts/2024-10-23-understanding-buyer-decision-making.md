<!-- ## Finding Clients Fast: My Strategy for Creative Entrepreneurs  -->


Today, we're tackling one of the most critical pieces of the puzzle: why clients choose certain creative service providers over others—and how you can make sure you’re the one they choose.

If you've ever been in a pitch or sent out a proposal only to hear crickets, you’re probably left wondering, "What went wrong?" It’s not always about having the best portfolio. There’s a whole decision-making process clients go through that’s beyond just the work itself. If you understand the factors they consider, you can shift the odds in your favor.
In this post, I’m going to break down the six key variables that clients use to make their decisions. This isn’t just theory—it’s based on what I’ve learned from working in the trenches, winning (and sometimes losing) projects, and refining my approach.

Mastering these decision-making variables can be the difference between landing that dream project or watching it go to your competitor.  So keep reading, and by the end of this, you’ll have the inside track on what really matters in client decisions—and how to position yourself to win.


## Understanding Buyer Decision-Making

Being a creative entrepreneur isn’t just about the work you do—it’s about understanding *why* clients pick you over someone else. If you're not thinking about this, you’re already behind. There’s a hierarchy to what influences buyer decisions, and if you can master it, you’ll walk into that next pitch confident and prepared to win. 

Here's the breakdown of six variables that can either lock in that deal—or cost you the project:

1. **Price**: Always top of mind, but don’t get too fixated on it. Cheapest doesn't always win.
2. **Convenience**: Can you make things easy for them? Faster, simpler, less hassle? This stuff matters.
3. **Customer Experience**: It’s all about how you make them feel. If you can deliver a smooth, enjoyable process, you're already ahead of the game.
4. **Quality**: This is a no-brainer. If your work speaks for itself, you’re in a great position.
5. **Relationship**: People do business with people they know and trust. If you’ve built that relationship equity, you’ll be hard to beat.
6. **Reputation**: Your reputation can do the talking for you. When you’re known for delivering consistently stellar results, clients are willing to pay a premium for your expertise.

## Price Vs. Value: Shift the Narrative

Price comes up, no doubt. But the key is to shift the focus from *just* cost to the value you bring. Cheap doesn’t always win—*smart* does. Clients need to see why you're worth every penny. Highlight your convenience, your quality, and how you go above and beyond to deliver.

## Creating Unforgettable Client Experiences

People remember how you made them feel. It’s all about creating an experience that feels effortless and seamless for your clients. Make them love working with you by keeping communication on point and never missing a beat. Reliability wins you more clients than a perfect pitch ever will.

## Quality Is King

Your work is your biggest calling card. Let your work do the talking for you. If your portfolio doesn’t scream high-quality, results-driven work, you’re going to have a tough time landing those big contracts. Always lead with the kind of work that showcases your strengths and meets your client’s goals.

## Relationships and Reputation: The Ultimate Weapons

Why do some agencies seem to land all the high-profile gigs? Relationships and reputation. Build trust, over-deliver, and always keep that long-term relationship in mind. If you're just starting out, focus on killing it with every new client and turning them into brand advocates. Word-of-mouth and a killer reputation will do wonders.

The more you understand why clients make the decisions they do, the more leverage you have in every pitch or proposal. Keep these six factors in your back pocket, and you’ll find yourself consistently outpacing the competition.
