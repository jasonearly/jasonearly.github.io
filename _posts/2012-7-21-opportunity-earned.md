A few times a year, mostly during the summer, the studio gets a number of random, unsolicited emails containing resumes and generic cover letter .PDFs from people who want to work here.  
<br/>

I’d like to issue an open letter in reply.  
<br/>

First off, thank you for your interest in what the studio does, and for wanting to be a part of it. It really means a lot to me.  
<br/>

Secondly, I’d like to confess something to you. I don’t care about your resume.  
It’s true: I don’t read them. Your resume tells me two things:  
<br/>

  *    Your attention to detail.
  *    Your ability to organize content.
<br/>

Now, both are important qualities, but are only parts of a bigger whole. Showing me that on screen, for a piece that is meant to be printed is already one strike against you. Thinking that I may actually print it out is another. Two strikes against you and I haven’t even seen your work yet. The odds are not in your favor.  
<br/>

We are in the creative services industry. If you can’t devise a creative way to get my attention, then that’s another conversation we can have at a later time.  
<br/>

So why do I not read resumes? In the hierarchy of things I need to know to consider offering someone an opportunity to work with me, a resume is probably third or fourth on the scale of importance. What are numbers one and two?
The work presented, and the person presenting. In that order.  
<br/>

Nothing else matters. Really.  
<br/>

Your work is what will get you in my door, but actually speaking to you will convince me to grant you an opportunity.  
<br/>

Did you catch that? Speaking with you — conversing — is the key. If you have the chance to talk with me about an opportunity, it is yours and yours alone to attain or to lose.  
<br/>

Now since I am writing about opportunities at gruntmonkey I’ll just go ahead and close with this:  
<br/>

Are there currently opportunities to work with gruntmonkey? There are ALWAYS opportunities to work with gruntmonkey. It’s up to you, the applicant, to convince me that you have earned it.
