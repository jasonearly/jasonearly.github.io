This has been a terrible weekend for Americans.     
With President Trumps fear mongering executive order on immigration and refugees, CNN is currently running this headline, "[Cell phone screening next?](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/donald-trump-immigrant-policy-social-media-contacts/index.html)"<br/><br/>    

This got me thinking of sharing steps showing how to protect your digital privacy, then I recalled the UK's recent online surveillance changes reported by [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13718768/uk-surveillance-laws-explained-investigatory-powers-bill) and their [similar tips](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/25/13746042/uk-surveillance-bill-private-browsing-online)  that followed. <br/><br/>    

While originally written to inform residents and travelers in the UK, these are good steps to take for any digital citizen worried about unlawful surveillance.<br/><br/>    

tl:dr version:<br/><br/>


1.   Use a Virtual Private Network. A good one will cost some money, I recommend [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/).
2.   Use an encrypted messaging app. Signal is highly recommended.   [ios](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8) / [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&hl=en)
3.   Use a web browser that supports anonymous browsing. The big browsers, Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox, all support this. Additionally you could use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html).
4.   And while you're at it strengthen your passwords! [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) will do this.

Stay safe.
