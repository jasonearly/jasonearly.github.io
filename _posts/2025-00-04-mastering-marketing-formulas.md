If you’ve ever stared at a blank screen, trying to write copy that actually converts, you’re not alone. Marketing your creative business can feel like solving a Rubik's cube blindfolded—overwhelming and frustrating. But here’s the good news: you don’t need to reinvent the wheel to craft effective, persuasive messaging.

In today’s post, I’m unpacking some of the most powerful marketing formulas that every creative entrepreneur needs in their toolkit. Whether you’re writing ad copy, building a landing page, or crafting the perfect email campaign, these formulas provide the structure you need to capture attention, communicate value, and inspire action.

Think of this as your shortcut to clarity and confidence in your marketing. 

Now grab your coffee, settle in, and let’s dive into the world of marketing formulas that will transform how you connect with your audience.


## Introduction to Marketing Formulas

When it comes to running a creative business, marketing isn’t just an afterthought—it’s a lifeline. You could have the most incredible design skills, the most innovative product, or the best services out there, but if you can’t communicate your value effectively, none of that matters.

That’s where marketing formulas come in. These aren’t just abstract concepts from a dusty old textbook. They’re practical, battle-tested strategies that have been used by top marketers for decades. In fact, you’ve probably encountered them yourself—whether in ads, emails, or websites that made you stop, pay attention, and, eventually, take action.

So today, I’m breaking down some of my favorite marketing formulas that I’ve personally used to help my business (and my clients’ businesses) thrive. From crafting headlines that grab attention to creating offers that feel irresistible, these formulas are the foundation of effective marketing.


#### Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS) Formula

First up, the classic PAS formula: Problem, Agitate, Solution.

Here’s how it works:

Start by identifying the problem your audience is struggling with.  
Then, agitate that pain—make them feel the weight of the issue.  
Finally, present your product or service as the ultimate solution to their problem.  

For example, let’s say you’re a freelance designer targeting small businesses. You might start with:

**Problem:** “Struggling to get noticed online because your website looks outdated?”
 **Agitate:** “An unprofessional website can make your business look untrustworthy and cost you customers.”  
 **Solution:** “Let me design a sleek, modern website that puts your brand’s best foot forward and turns visitors into loyal customers.”

This formula works because it taps into emotion and positions you as the hero who can fix their problem.


#### Features-Advantages-Benefits (FAB) Formula

The FAB formula is all about showing why your offering matters.

**Features:** What does your product or service do?  
 **Advantages:** How does it help your audience?  
 **Benefits:** What’s the tangible result they’ll experience?  

For instance, if you’re a brand strategist:

**Feature:** “My service includes a complete brand audit and strategy report.”  
 **Advantage:** “This gives you a roadmap for consistent and effective branding across all platforms.”  
 **Benefit:** “You’ll attract your ideal customers and stand out from the competition.”  

FAB helps bridge the gap between what you do and why your audience should care.


#### Before-After-Bridge (BAB) Formula

People love stories—especially ones about transformation. The BAB formula leverages this by focusing on three stages:

 **Before:** Where your audience is right now (struggling, overwhelmed, stuck).  
 **After:** Where they want to be (successful, confident, thriving).  
 **Bridge:** How you’ll help them get there.  

Let’s say you’re selling an online course for freelance designers:

 **Before:** “You’re stuck taking low-paying projects and feeling burned out.”  
 **After:** “Imagine working with dream clients who value your expertise—and earning what you’re worth.”  
 **Bridge:** “My course gives you the tools, strategies, and templates to transform your freelance business in 90 days.”  

This formula resonates because it paints a vivid picture of what’s possible while positioning you as the guide to their success.


#### PPPP Formula: Promise, Picture, Proof, Push

The PPPP formula is a powerhouse for persuasive copy:  

 **Promise:** Start with a bold, attention-grabbing statement.  
 **Picture:** Paint a vivid picture of what success looks like.  
 **Proof:** Back it up with testimonials, case studies, or data.  
 **Push:** End with a compelling call to action.  

For example:

 **Promise:** “Double your client inquiries in 30 days.”  
 **Picture:** “Imagine waking up to an inbox full of leads from dream clients.”  
 **Proof:** “See how Sarah, a fellow designer, landed $10k in new projects after applying these strategies.”  
 **Push:** “Sign up now and start transforming your business today.”  

It’s concise, effective, and drives action.


#### Star-Chain-Hook Formula

This formula is all about storytelling, and who doesn’t love a good story?

**Star:** Make your client the hero.  
 **Chain:** Build interest by outlining the steps or benefits they’ll gain.  
 **Hook:** End with a call to action that compels them to take the next step.  

For instance:

 **Star:** “You’re a talented creative who deserves to thrive in your business.”  
 **Chain:** “With my proven frameworks, you’ll attract better clients, charge what you’re worth, and build a business you love.”  
 **Hook:** “Let’s make it happen—schedule your free consultation today.”  

This approach makes your audience feel seen and empowered, which is key to building trust.


## Conclusion

As creative entrepreneurs, our success isn’t just about our craft—it’s about how well we can communicate our value. These marketing formulas are your secret weapon for doing just that.

So, which formula will you try first? Whether it’s PAS, FAB, BAB, or PPPP, I encourage you to put these into practice and watch how they transform your messaging.

Here’s to more clarity, connection, and conversions.
